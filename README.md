## Using GitHub
The following instructions assume the user has

1. A GitHub account
2. Git installed on machine
    - Note to Windows users: during setup, make sure to select "Run Git From Windows Command Prompt"
    - To configure,
```sh
$ git config --global user.name "usernamehere"
$ git config --global user.email youremail@example.com
```

##### One-Time Actions 
These only need to be done once:
- Fork CSCI3308_Project1 repository on GitHub 
- Clone fork to computer using 
```sh
$ git clone [git-repo-url]
```

### Development
##### Pull, Commit, Push
- Always pull before committing for fewer conflicts between master and fork! 
    - see "Keeping Your Fork Up-to-Date"
- If ready to contribute code modifications to master, return to level of CSCI3308_Project1 directory, then
```sh
$ git status                            # display unadded paths
$ git add file                     		# add file or path to file
$ git status                            # check if path is added
$ git commit -m "messagehere"           # commit to fork
$ git push                              # add modified fork to GitHub
```
    - Note that the commit message uses single quotes on Linux systems
    
- Go to GitHub and create pull request from the fork
    - Click the green button in the upper left

##### Keeping Your Fork Up-To-Date
The following is necessary to keep your fork up-to-date with changes in the master. 
- Add remote from original repository into fork
```sh
# This is a one-time action
$ cd locationonmachine/CSCI3308_Project1           
$ git remote add upstream [git-repo-url]    
```
- Fetch all branches of remote into remote tracking branch
```sh
$ git fetch upstream                     
```
- Update fork from original to keep up with changes
```sh
$ git pull upstream master
```

## To Run
The following instructions assume the user has

1. Python 2
2. Python package <i>Setuptools</i> installed
3. Pip installed

##### Set Up Database
In CSCI3308_Project1/Platypus, run
```sh
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

##### Run Local Host
Then, run
```sh
python manage.py runserver
```
This will open up a local development server at http://localhost:8000/matchApp/

## Team Rules & Guidelines
1. Communicate intentions to learn/accomplish a goal of the project to other members.
2. Communicate intentions to accomplish class assignments so that we can work together.
3. Establish weekly meetings for in-person communications. Otherwise communicate clearly that no meeting is needed.
4. Project guidelines for each step will be clearly shown to all members.
5. If a great resource is found for project-related learning, it will be posted to the other team members for reading.
6. Sync regularly with GitHub repository and alert team members to changes.
